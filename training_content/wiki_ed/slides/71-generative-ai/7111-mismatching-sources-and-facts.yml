title: "Harm: Mismatching sources and facts"

  Another reason to always read your sources carefully? AI tools may cite a real source — but
  the source may not have anything to do with the fact or topic itself.

  For example, the highlighted information below added to Wikipedia by a student doing the same
  assignment as you cites a real source. However, the cited research article doesn’t mention azo
  dyes or connect them to inflammation in the gut, as the text explains.

  *... however, they are all known to contain carcinogens<sup>[1]</sup>. <mark>The gut microbiota is
  crucial for metabolizing compounds, such as azo dyes. The enyzmes used to metabolize these compounds split
  the azo bonds to form metabolites. These metabolites can generate reactive oxygen species, which foster
  oxidative stress and inflammation<sup>[2]</sup>.</mark> Inflammation in the tissues with the ...*

  While the fact may be true, the information in the cited source doesn’t back it up — which is
  the entire purpose of citations! So, even if an AI tool directs you to a real source, you can’t
  be sure of the information it provides unless you read it yourself. Always take the time to
  carefully review and verify every source/citation when contributing to Wikipedia!
