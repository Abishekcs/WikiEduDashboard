title: "Harm: Mismatching sources and facts"
content: |
  Another reason to always read your sources carefully? AI tools may cite a real source — but
  the source may not have anything to do with the fact or topic itself.

  For example, the highlighted information below (which had to be deleted from a live Wikipedia article)
  cites a real source. However, the cited research article doesn’t mention azo dyes or connect them to
  inflammation in the gut, as the text explains.

  *... however, they are all known to contain carcinogens<sup>[1]</sup>. <mark>The gut microbiota is
  crucial for metabolizing compounds, such as azo dyes. The enyzmes used to metabolize these compounds split
  the azo bonds to form metabolites. These metabolites can generate reactive oxygen species, which foster
  oxidative stress and inflammation<sup>[2]</sup>.</mark> Inflammation in the tissues with the ...*

  So, even if an AI tool directs you to a real source, you can’t trust the tool to correctly
  use that source in a citation. Always take the time to carefully verify every source/citation
  yourself when contributing to Wikipedia!
