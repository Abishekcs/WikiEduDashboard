title: A word of caution
content: |
  Be warned — using AI to generate new text for a Wikipedia article is one of the fastest
  ways to get everything you added deleted! That’s because generative AI tools can
  fabricate “facts” and hallucinate “sources” — and adding fake content to Wikipedia
  will make it worse for everyone, not better.

  Generative AI tools do a poor job writing about things missing from Wikipedia, because
  their own knowledge is largely based on what’s already on Wikipedia. In fact, sometimes
  it may suggest adding content to Wikipedia even when there are no sources to support that
  information. Your ability to evaluate sources, review them carefully, and synthesize the
  information they provide is essential to improving the encyclopedia!

  Remember, anything you add to Wikipedia will be attributed to your username. Readers
  will assume you wrote everything yourself and you have fully verified your sources,
  which is critical to everyone who visits Wikipedia looking for reliable information.

  So, how can AI tools be used carefully and intentionally to help improve Wikipedia?
  Let’s explore some ideas.
