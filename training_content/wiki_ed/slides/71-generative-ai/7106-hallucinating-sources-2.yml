title: "Harm: Hallucinating sources (example 2)"
content: |
  Here’s another real-life example of how AI made a bad recommendation to a student
  working on their Wikipedia assignment. An AI chatbot suggested this source:

  * Shaw, Charles Thurstan (1971). "The Lejja excavations". *The Journal of African History*. 12 (3): 365–384.

  It looks like a legitimate peer-reviewed journal article, doesn’t it? Charles Thurstan Shaw
  was a real archeologist and he did publish research about present day Nigeria during the
  early 1970s. But guess what? He never wrote the paper in the citation above — it was
  completely made up by the AI chatbot!

  Every fact added to Wikipedia needs to cite a valid, reliable source in line with Wikipedia’s
  [source policy](https://dashboard.wikiedu.org/training/students/evaluating-articles/what-is-a-good-source),
  so accidentally using fake sources provided by AI tools is incredibly harmful.
  Be sure to thoroughly review all of your sources when editing Wikipedia.

  Never cite a source you haven’t read yourself!
