  After you collect and review your sources carefully, you’ll use information
  from those sources to write new text for the related Wikipedia article. Once
  you’ve drafted your text, you could consider using an AI tool as a copy editor.

  Ask the tool to help pinpoint any potential problem areas in your writing, including:

  * grammar, spelling, or punctuation errors
  * sentences that are not written in a neutral, encyclopedic style
  * facts that are missing a citation

  *Example: Copy edit the following text, with a particular focus on finding grammar,
  spelling, or punctuation errors, any text not written in a neutral and encyclopedic
  tone, and any facts that may be missing a citation: [insert the new text you wrote
  for the Wikipedia article]*
