title: "Help: Finding access to sources"
content: |
  Perhaps you’ve found a reference to a source that seems like a great addition
  to a Wikipedia article, but you’re having trouble locating the full text of it.
  Try asking a generative AI tool if it can locate an access point to the source.

  *Example: To properly cite and reference this study in my assignment, I need
  access to the full text of this peer-reviewed article: Yaghoobian and Kleissl,
  "Effect of reflective pavements on building energy use". Which academic databases
  or library services provide access to 2012 issues of Urban Climate?*
