title: Do NOT add images generated by AI
content: |
  Finding copyright-free images to add to Wikipedia can be tricky — that’s
  why we recommend you only upload photos that you took yourself.

  ***Images generated by AI must NOT be added to Wikipedia.*** Wikipedia is an
  encyclopedia, and readers expect its images to accurately reflect reality.
  Illustrations must be factual and representational — grounded in verifiable,
  real-world subjects — not artificially generated or imagined. AI-generated
  images do not meet this standard.

  *As you work through your Wikipedia assignment, keep in mind the ways generative
  AI tools can be both helpful and harmful. And remember, always defer to the AI
  policies of your institution and instructor.*
