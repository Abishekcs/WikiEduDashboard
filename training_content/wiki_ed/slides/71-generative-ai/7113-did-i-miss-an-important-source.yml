title: "Help: Did I miss an important source?"
content: |
  Think you’ve found all of the available sources related to the article you’re editing?
  Ask a generative AI tool if there are other sources you should read and consider citing
  in the article. 

  *Example: I want to improve the Wikipedia article on [insert article title]: [link].
  I have already consulted and used the following sources: [list of sources]. Could you
  suggest additional secondary sources — such as scholarly books, peer-reviewed journal
  articles, or reliable news publications — that meet Wikipedia’s reliable source standards
  and would strengthen the article’s coverage?"*

  First, confirm whether the sources it suggests actually exist — AI tools can make up
  fake sources! Be sure to read them thoroughly and double-check that all sources you
  use actually meet Wikipedia’s [source policy](https://dashboard.wikiedu.org/training/students/evaluating-articles/what-is-a-good-source).
  Remember, do not take an AI tool up on its suggestion to summarize the article or
  craft sample wording for Wikipedia.

  On the next slide, we’ll talk about why it’s essential that you carefully
  review any source suggested by an AI tool.
