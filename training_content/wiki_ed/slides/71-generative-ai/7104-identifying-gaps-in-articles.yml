title: "Help: Identifying gaps in articles"
content: |
  Have you read through your Wikipedia article, researched the topic thoroughly,
  and believe you have identified all information gaps in the article’s
  coverage of the topic? If you feel confident that you’ve found all of the
  gaps, you can ask a generative AI tool if it can find anything else that is
  missing from the article, just in case.

  *Example, using the fictional chemist “Jane Smith”: I’m reviewing this Wikipedia article about chemist Jane Smith and
  noticed that it lacks details about her educational background, early career,
  and scientific collaborations. Based on Wikipedia’s guidelines for biographical
  coverage, what additional verifiable information might be missing that would
  help make this article more comprehensive and balanced? [add link to the Wikipedia
  article about Jane Smith]*

  Then, use your own knowledge of the topic from your research to decide if the
  AI tool correctly identified any additional gaps. It won’t always get it right,
  so be sure to use **your own** critical thinking skills!
