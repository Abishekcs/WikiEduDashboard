title: AI as a helper, not a starting point
summary:
content: |
  Generative AI tools (like ChatGPT or Gemini) can be helpful tools when
  translating Wikipedia articles, but they should support your work â€“ not replace it. 

  If your institution and instructor policies allow AI use, you could ask an AI
  tool to compare your translated work to the original text and identify any
  inconsistencies or grammatical errors. 

  Do NOT ask an AI tool to translate the text for you. It might give you a
  text that looks good, but actually fabricates information, mistranslates
  key terms, or loses important nuance and tone from the original text.

  Need a refresher on the dangers of using AI to generate text for
  Wikipedia? Revisit the [Generative AI training module](/training/students/generative-ai).
