title: A note on Generative AI
summary:
content: |
  If you use Generative AI tools (like ChatGPT or Gemini) to summarize a source,
  do not copy that summary directly into Wikipedia. 

  These tools will often rephrase content while retaining the sentence and
  paragraph structure. While this may get past plagiarism checkers, itâ€™s
  still a copyright infringement and is forbidden on Wikipedia.

  Content that violates copyright may be deleted entirely, not just reverted.
  Repeatedly doing this can result in being blocked from editing Wikipedia.
