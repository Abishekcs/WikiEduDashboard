  Generative AI tools (like ChatGPT or Gemini) can sometimes be useful to help search for sources,
  but their results should also be evaluated carefully. Generative AI can falsely attribute
  claims to sources , or “hallucinate” sources that don’t exist.

  Another AI issue to watch out for? AI tools will often point to sources that don’t fit
  Wikipedia’s definition of reliable sources.
