title: When should you cite?
summary:
content: |
  In general, you should cite at least once per paragraph you contribute to
  Wikipedia. Any quotations, hard facts (such as statistics) and
  controversial claims must be cited.

  Basically, whenever you add information to an article, be sure to include
  references.

  Using AI tools? Remember, AI may give you fake references, or incorrectly
  cite a source for an unrelated fact. Always read through sources yourself
  before citing them on Wikipedia.
