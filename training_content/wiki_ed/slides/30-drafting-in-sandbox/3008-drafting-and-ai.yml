  When you read and verify your sources before writing, you’re able to
  verify that the information you’re adding accurately reflects what’s
  in your sources.
  
  Generative AI tools (like ChatGPT or Gemini) can’t fact-check sources
  to see whether their claims are actually supported by the sources they
  cite. If you use them to draft your work, you risk adding factually
  inaccurate or misleading information to Wikipedia, which harms readers.

  Need a refresher on the dangers of using AI to generate text for
  Wikipedia? Revisit the [Generative AI training module](/training/students/generative-ai).
