title: "Best practices for building a new article"
content: |
  If you are creating a new Wikipedia article rather than improving an existing one,
  you'll need to prepare an initial version â€” consisting of a two-paragraph summary
  of the topic, with citations to at least three good sources. Do this on the
  **Sandbox Draft** page (linked from "My Articles" on your Dashboard course page.)
  When you are ready to make it live, [follow the instructions here](/training/students/moving-to-mainspace/moving-a-new-article-out-of-the-sandbox-v2).

  Don't write more than you need to in order to clearly define the topic
  and establish its significance before moving it live. Once it is live,
  other editors can identify major problems, and you want to have time to
  correct them so that your work sticks around on Wikipedia.

  Once you've moved it live, you'll continue expanding and improving it
  just as you would an already-existing article.
